# database-app

This is my database REST API project using REACT. The data added to the database is data of the most valuable football players in the world. 
Source: https://www.transfermarkt.com/spieler-statistik/wertvollstespieler/marktwertetop.

On this page you can: 
Fetch the data from the database
Search for different values from the data
Add new data using POST
Modify the data using PUT
Delete the data using DELETE

I uploaded a YouTube video showing how the app works since Heroku wasn't possible to use.
